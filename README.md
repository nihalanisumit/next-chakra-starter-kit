This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) and uses Chakra UI and SWR with JS.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the blank page.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`.

API part is removed and the folder structure is changed such that everything is inside src directory.

Also absolute imports are setup and baseUrl is set to src. Edit jsconfig.json file to change the behaviour.
